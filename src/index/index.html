						First, you must head to the Circlegame <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/cop3czb7pqy3mtb/circlegame_v1.2.0.zip/file" target="_blank">download page</a> on Mediafire.

						Once the download is complete, you should see a circlegame_v1.2.0.zip file in your system's downloads folder.
						The final step is to right click on this file and click "Extract All".
						Once complete, the extracted folder should appear with the Circlegame application inside of it.

					<h1> Help develop Circlegame! </h1>
					<hr>
					<p>
						Unfortunately, as of the release of v1.2.0 of Circlegame, the original creators of Circlegame have no intention of officially releasing new updates to the game in the near future.
						Therefore, we have decided that the best course of action to make Circlegame open-source and easily accessible for anyone to contribute if they so please.
						The Circlegame source code can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/josef-karpinski/circlegame">GitHub repository</a>, which also includes instructions on how code in Circlegame's development environment (Processing.org).
						Although you won't see your contributions to the game immediately be implemented, be sure that one day we will review your pull requests and implement your changes into the next release!
