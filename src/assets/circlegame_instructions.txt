Installing Circlegame is fairly easy and only takes a few minutes to complete.

First, you must head to the Circlegame <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/cop3czb7pqy3mtb/circlegame_v1.2.0.zip/file" target="_blank">download page</a> on Mediafire.

Next, in the black box labeled "circlegame_v1.2.0", click on the blue download button labeled "DOWNLOAD (169.8MB)".

Once the download is complete, you should see a circlegame_v1.2.0.zip file in your system's downloads folder.

The final step is to right click on this file and click "Extract All".

Once complete, the extracted folder should appear with the Circlegame application inside of it.

For ease of use, we recommend that you create a desktop shortcut to the application, or even pin it to your taskbar!


Note: Circlegame is only available on Windows OS.
